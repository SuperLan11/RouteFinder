## Project Background
The RouteFinder program was made to help me find routes of specific distances for my runs.
The program uses a text file of landmarks and their associated distances as one input.
The other two inputs are the desired distance and the number of routes to print.

## How to Use the Project
Press the green code button, download the ZIP, and extract the folder. 
Open RouteFinder.sln, then open RouteFinder.cpp in source files. 
Then run the program. The closest routes will be printed to the console.
